# WashU_SP2020.CSE517A_Machine-Learning

**Overview**: This course covers advanced topics at the frontier of the field in-depth. Topics to be covered include kernel methods (support vector machines, Gaussian processes), neural networks (deep learning), and unsupervised learning. Depending on developments in the field, the course will also cover some advanced topics, which may include learning from structured data, active learning, and practical machine learning (feature selection, dimensionality reduction).  

**Course site**: https://sites.wustl.edu/neumann/courses/cse517a/sp19/  

**Language(s) Used**: Python  

**Aim**: Understand advanced Machine Learning methods and techniques.  
Rather than only applying machine learning methods such as scikit learn, in this class, we construct codes and methods from scrach. Thus, this class gives me a more solid understanding in machine learning.  


## Project 1: Structural Risk Minimization
**Building an email spam filter**  

1. implement the loss functions:  
  Ridge Regression  
  Logistic Regression  
  Hinge loss  
2. implement grdescent  
3. implement linear model function  
4. train the model  
5. validation and visualization   
  fpr  
  tpr  
  AUC
6. make prediction  
  
 ## Project 2: Naïve Bayes
**Implement Naïve Bayes to predict if a name is male or female**  
1. compute P(X|Y)  
2. compute P(Y)  
3. compute log probability log P(Y|X = x1)  
4. compute log loss  
5. turn the Naïve Bayes output into a linear classifier  
6. make predictions  

## Project 3: SVM
